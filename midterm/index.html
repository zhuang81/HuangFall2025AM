                <h1>LUCY THE TUXEDO </h1>
                <p>This is my cat, Lucy, she joined our family in May this year and already has become my sleeping
                    buddy.
                    She loves to curl up next to me, under my arms, suck on her nipples and slowly falls asleep. She
                    also
                    stole my pillow and made it her bed and sometimes she would go under my blanket and nap between my
                    leg.
                </p>
            </header>
            <main>
                <h2> MORE ABOUT HER</h2>

                <p>She loved the blue feather teaser I got her when she first arrived, she would jump up and down
                    with it. Until she was having too much playing and the feather broke off.
                </p>
                <p>Then I discovered she might like strings more…. Because she chewed up a finger long blue string
                    and swallowed it when I looked away for 1 second. I was super worried, waiting for the string to
                    safely pass through
                    her stomach. days and days, when I forgot about it, I found a familiar looking blue string in
                    her litter box. Never letting her touch string again… </p>
                <p> But she quickly found out that hair ties are fun too! Sometimes she would bring all the hair
                    ties she found under the bed to my pillow.
                </p>
                <p>Every morning, instead of my alarm waking me up, i hear Lucy meowing for treats. Sometimes I wish
                    she can be a good kitty and let me sleep for longer but I just can't ever be mad at her.</p>
