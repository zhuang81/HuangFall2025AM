            <h1>Tapinella atrotomentosa</h1>
            <p>commonly known as the velvet roll-rim or velvet-footed tap,is a species of fungus in the family
                Tapinellaceae. Although it has gills, it is a member of the pored mushroom order Boletales. August
                Batsch described the species in 1783. It has been recorded from Eurasia and North America. Tough and
                inedible, it grows on tree stumps of conifers. The mushroom contains several compounds that act as
                deterrents of feeding by insects.</p>

                    <h3>Taxonomy</h3>
                    <p>Tapinella atrotomentosa was originally described as Agaricus atrotomentosus by German naturalist
                        August Batsch in his 1783 work Elenchus Fungorum,and given its current name by Josef Šutara
                        in 1992.It is commonly known as the "velvet-footed pax",and the "velvet rollrim".
                        Historical synonyms include Paxillus atrotomentosus by Elias Magnus Fries (1833), Rhymovis
                        atrotomentosa by Gottlob Ludwig Rabenhorst (1844),and Sarcopaxillus atrotomentosus by Ivan
                        Zmitrovich (2004).The variety bambusinus was described from Trinidad in 1951 by British
                        mycologists Richard Eric Defoe Baker and William Thomas Dale.</p>
                    <p>The species name is derived from the Latin words atrotomentosus, meaning "black-haired" It
                        is still commonly seen under its old name Paxillus atrotomentosus in guidebooks.Tapinella
                        atrotomentosa and its relative T. panuoides were placed in a separate genus Tapinella on account
                        of their habit of growing on (and rotting) wood, and microscopic differences including much
                        smaller spore size, lack of cystidia, and differing basidia.Their off-centre stipe also
                        distinguished them from other members of the genus Paxillus, and genetic analysis confirmed
                        them as only distantly related.</p>

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>The fruit body is squat mushroom with a cap up to 20 cm (8 in) wide,[15] sepia- or walnut brown
                        in colour with a rolled rim and depressed centre. The gills are cream-yellow and forked. The
                        thick stipe juts out sidewards from the mushroom;it is up to 12 cm long and dark brown,
                        covered with dark brown velvety fur.</p>
                    <p>The flesh is yellowish,and has been described as appetising in appearance, and is little
                        affected by insects;the taste however is acrid.The spore print is yellowish to
                        brownish and the spores are round to oval, measuring 5–6 μm long.[1</p>

                    <h3>Habitat</h3>
                    <p>It is a saprobic fungus found growing on tree stumps of conifers in North America, Europe,[20]
                        Central America (Costa Rica),[21] east into Asia where it has been recorded from Pakistan[22]
                        and China.[23] The fruit bodies appear in summer and autumn, even in drier spells when other
                        mushrooms are not evident.</p>

                    <h3>Toxicity</h3>
                    <p>The mushrooms are not generally considered edible,[11] but have been used as a food source in
                        parts of eastern Europe.[20] The species contains toxins which may cause gastrointestinal
                        upset.[24] There have been cases of poisoning reported in European literature.[25] Linus
                        Zeitlmayr reports that young mushrooms are edible, but warns than older ones have a foul bitter
                        or inky flavour and are possibly poisonous.[19] The bitter flavour is allegedly improved by
                        boiling the mushrooms and discarding the water, but is indigestible to many.</p>
                    <p>Tests on the chemical composition and free amino acid levels of the mushroom suggest that they
                        are not considerably different from other edible gilled mushrooms such as Armillaria mellea.</p>
