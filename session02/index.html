            This tropical strain of oyster mushroom grows in eye-catching, layered clusters on dead and decaying
            hardwood. The caps range in color from pale salmon to deep, rosy pink. When cooked, the vibrant pink color
            fades to a
            golden-brown or orange.(source:wikipedia)

        <blockquote>
            "The flavor of the pink oyster mushroom has been described as meaty and fishy. Just like most
            mushrooms, it is quite umami. Its texture is both meaty and chewy. When fried until crispy, it resembles
            bacon or even ham. However, when it is raw, it has a sour taste."
