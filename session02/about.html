        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>
            The reason why it is very rare to find in supermarkets is that it has a shelf life of only about a day,
            quickly developing an unpleasant amine or urine-like odor after that time. Since it is only harvested from
            spring to fall, it is only available during those seasons.[5]
        </p>
        <p>The pink oyster mushroom grows in tropical and subtropical areas, growing as far north as Japan and as far
            south as New Zealand.[2] In Hawai'i, pink oyster mushrooms often grow on fallen coconuts, and on the stalks
            of palm fronds, though they can also be found on fallen ōhiʻa branches in the forests of the Hawaiian island
            Kaua'i.[3]

        <h3>Cultural Significance</h3>
        <p>Pink oyster mushrooms are a commonly found specimen in central Mexican communities. It is the most well known
            mushroom in Tlayacapan, Morelos, with 98.8% of surveyed locals being able to identify it.[citation needed]
            The species is collected by families and then often sold at vendors markets. Locals call it a variety of
            names: "seta", "cazahuate", "orejón", "hongo de pino", "blanco", "oreja de cazahuate".[10] Pink oyster
            mushrooms are also sold, door-to-door by mestizos in mountainous communities, such as San Lorenzo de
            Atzqueltán and Izolta.[11]</p>
